(Or is it BooTrap?)

### No it's not a trap, it's a lifesaver! *For some.*

Time to get started on our first official Bootstrap project! Now that we know our way through plain CSS, let's have Bootstrap do the work for us.

In this project we will be copying a simple (made up) Code Immersives website. You can see how it should look (and work!) [here](http://copy-tabby-solution.surge.sh/).


### Basic Guidelines.

* Check out the [Bootstrap docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/), they will be your main resource.
* Everything is a Bootstrap component! It's Bootstrap all the way down... You can play with the css, but you'll find you need little if you really make everything a Bootstrap component!
* The start up code is in this repo; you just need to add Bootstrap classes!
* Some components may be inside other components, so if you don't see an overarching component in the Bootstrap docs, look for its individual parts (otherwise known as... components).
